    <h1>My Story</h1>
    <section>
        <div class = "about">
            <p>Welcome! My name is Madeleine Lasky, and I am currently a student 
                at the University of Pittsburgh majoring in Computer Science. Growing up 
                with the skyline of towering skyscrapers and golden bridges in the distance, 
                I have always been fascinated by the relationship between creative mindsets 
                and innovation. My journey into the world of technology has been 
                a rather untraditional one. Prior to computer science, I studied design and marketing 
                at the Savannah College of Art and Design. It was during my time at SCAD, in between
                organizing marketing campaigns and drafting fashion lookbooks, that I 
                realized my true passion involved the connection between art and science as opposed
                to a focus on solely one of those endeavors. 
            </p>

        <p class ="biography_continued">
            When I discovered Computer Science, I quickly realized the necessity of a creative 
            mindset when engineering a solution. Although my past is untraditional,
            I am a firm believer in the idea that our past experiences
            mold us into well-rounded individuals. While some would view the prospect of 
            a blank file as a nightmare, I approach it as a blank canvas full of potential.
            Whereas some may view learning a new programming language as daunting, I look at it
            as another medium to use in order to accomplish my vision. 
            <span id="emphasis">Although I am no longer an artist in the traditional sense, 
            I am still a creative person at heart who aims to break the boundaries of what 
            I believe I am capable of.
